# dotfiles

These are my personal settings for various UNIX programs

This repo is designed to be easily downloaded and applied through the 
included 'install.sh' script. install.sh copies the existing dotfiles 
into a directory called dotfiles_old in the home directory then replaces 
the dotfiles with symbolic links to the ones stored in the dotfiles 
directory
